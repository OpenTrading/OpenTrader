# OpenTrader

OpenTrader

https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/

This project gives a command-line interpreter to communicate with
an OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge enabled MetaTrader
(https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/).
You can subscribe to tick, bar, and timer events,
query, open and close orders, and execute Metatrader code remotely.
If you have pyrabbit installed, you can query the AMQP server.

Coming Real Soon Now(TM) is backtesting of trading recipes,
reading Metatrader history into pandas DataFrames, plotting
DataFrames using matplotlib, and live-trading on Metatrader from recipes.

It builds on OTMql4AMQP, and requires that to be installed in your
Metatrader Python as a pre-requisite, if you want to do live trading.
In your Python, you also must have installed Pika:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/, which must be accessible to your
OTMql4Py (https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/).
You will have to call OTCmd2 with the `-P` option with the
path of your installed Metatrader (e.g. `c:\Program Files\Metatrader`),
or add your installed OTMql4Py Python directory to the `PYTHONPATH`
environment variable (e.g. `c:\Program Files\Metatrader\MQL4\Python`).

**This is a work in progress - a developers' pre-release version.**

The project wiki should be open for editing by anyone logged into GitHub:
**Please report any system it works or doesn't work on in the wiki:
include the Metatrader build number, the origin of the metatrader exe,
the Windows version, and the AMQP server version and version of the Pika.**
This code in known to run under Linux Wine (1.7.x), so this project
bridges Metatrader to RabbitMQ under Linux.

### Installation

```
python setup.py
```
to create the OTCmd2 script. Run `OTCmd2 help` (see below).

In your Metatrader Python, you also must have installed Pika:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pika/ as well as
OTMql4AMQP (https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4AMQP/),
OTMql4Py (https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/), and
OTMql4Lib (https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/).

It's better to use the wiki for knowledge capture, and then we can pull
the important pages back into the documentation in the share/doc directory.
You will need to be signed into github.com to see or edit in the wiki.
