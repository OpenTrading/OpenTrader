## PikaCmd2.py

This script can be run from the command line to send commands
to a OTMql4AMQP enabled Metatrader. It will start a command loop to
listen, send commands, or query the RabbitMQ management interface, based 
on the cmd2 REPL: see cmd2plus.py in `OpenTrader`

Type help at the command prompt to get more help.

Call the script with `--help` to see the script options.

The normal usage is:
```
sub run timer# retval.#  - start a thread listening for messages: timer,tick,retval
pub cmd AccountBalance   - to send a command to OTMql4Pika,
                         the return will be a retval message on the listener
sub hide timer           - stop seeing timer messages (just see the retval.#)
orders list              - list your open order tickets
```

Use the `chart` command to
set and query the chart used for messages to and from RabbitMQ.
The chart ID will look something like: oChart_EURGBP_240_93ACD6A2_1

Use the `subscribe` command to suscribe to RabbitMQ topics from the
`OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4` expert advisor.
Common RabbitMQ topic patterns are: # for all messages, tick.# for ticks,
timer.# for timer events, retval.# for return values.
You can choose as specific chart with syntax like:
```
    tick.oChart.EURGBP.240.93ACD6A2.#
```

Use the `publish` command to publish a message via RabbitMQ to a given chart
on a OTMql4Py enabled terminal running the `OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4` expert advisor.
See the library files `MQL4/Libraries/OTMql4OTLibProcessCmd.mq4`
and `OTLibMt4ProcessCmd.mq4` in the OTMql4Py package for the commands
that are supported.

Use the `orders` to list, query, open and close orders in Mt4.

If you have `pyrabbit` installed, and iff the rabbitmq_management plugin
has been installed in your server, you can introspect some useful
information if the HTTP interface is enabled with the `rabbit` command.

### Messaging Format

The messaging to and from OTMql4Py is still being done with a
very simple format:
```
      sMsgType|sChartId|sIgnored|sMark|sPayload
```
where
```
      sMsgType is one of: cmd eval (outgoing), timer tick retval (incoming);
      sChartId is the Mt4 chart sChartId the message is to or from;
      sMark is a simple floating point timestamp, with milliseconds;
and   sPayload is command|arg1|arg2... (outgoing) or type|value (incoming),
      where type is one of: bool int double string json.
```
This breaks if the sPayload args or value contain a | -
we will probably replace this with json or pickled serialization, or kombu.
