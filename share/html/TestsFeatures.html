<h2>Features Tests</h2>

<p><a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a> are the starting point for our Behaviour Driven Development (BDD).<br />
The use cases are elaborated into required feature need to fulfil<br />
the use case, which are turned into BDD test features and scenarios.</p>

<p>The currently documented features can be found in the <br />
<a href="tests/features/">https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/</a><br />
directory of the distribution.</p>

<p>We have been using <a href="py-bdd">https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/</a>; from<br />
the top-level directory of the distribution, you could run the <tt>py-bdd</tt> tests with</p>
<pre>
py.test -v tests/
</pre>

<p>But we are having "issues" with <tt>py-bdd</tt>, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>no real documentation, just a README file;</li>
	<li>the code contradicts the documentation, about not reusing paraterized steps;</li>
	<li>the automatic generation of fixtures from step implmentations is too "magical"  for our tastes - we would like fixtures to be explicitly declared with a decorator;</li>
	<li>it is inspired by <tt>behave</tt>, but with a number of design decisions that differ,  such as enforcing a step type with the name, which are largely undocumented;</li>
</ul>
<p>We will stay with <a href="behave">https://github.com/behave/behave</a> as our BDD system<br />
and watch the evolution of the two projects. Behave is stable, not overengineered,<br />
evolving well, and the code is easy to money-patch or experiment with new features.<br />
The most important thing is to have the BDD use-case decision process for development,<br />
and to use the BDD feature files to document the implementation of the use-cases.<br />
We additionally use them to generate our examples, and our wiki pages: triple use!</p>

<p>From the top-level directory of the distribution, you could run the <tt>behave</tt> BDD<br />
tests with:</p>
<pre>
behave -v --capture tests/
</pre>
<p>(<tt>--capture</tt> is enabled by default, but you can't use <tt>--no-capture</tt>.)</p>

<p>This will create a directory at the top-level directory of the distribution<br />
called <tt>tmp</tt> where the BDD tests generate the scripts in <tt>share/examples</tt>.<br />
We generate our example scripts from the BDD documentation, and the generated<br />
example scripts should be identical with the scripts in <tt>share/examples</tt>.</p>

<p>We no longer run the tests with <tt>pytest-bdd</tt> so there may be problems<br />
running them now, but the systems are so similar, it is usually easy to bring<br />
implementations from <tt>behave</tt> to <tt>pytest-bdd</tt>. All Features that did<br />
run with <tt>pytest-bdd</tt> are marked with the <tt>@pytest</tt> tag, and should still run,<br />
but new features and scenari may not be picked up by the <tt>pytest-bdd</tt> runner.</p>

<h3>Features Test Tags</h3>

<p>Features are tagged with these tags, that may have the preconditions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>@rabbitctl - requires you have pyrabbit installed:    <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrabbit">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyrabbit</a>    and have the 'rabbitmq_management' plugin to rabbitmq enabled,    and the rabbitmq server running.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@examples  - generates share/examples files</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@pybacktest - should run under <tt>pytest-bdd</tt> as well as behave.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@Mt4Running - tests will only work if you have an OTMql4AMQP enabled Metatrader running,</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@OTMql4Zmq - tests will only work if you have an OTMql4Zmq enabled Metatrader running,    the Experts/OTMql4/OTZmqCmdEA.mq4 attached to a chart in it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@OTMql4AMQP - tests will only work if you have an OTMql4AMQP enabled Metatrader running,    the Experts/OTMql4/OTPyTestPikaEA.mq4 attached to a chart in it, and    the RabbitMQ server configured and running.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@Mt4Connected -  the Metatrader is logged in and connected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@examples - generates examples script files</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@pytest - should run under <tt>pytest-bdd</tt> as well as behave.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>@wip        - work-in-progress - may or may not work</li>
	<li>@fixme      - work-in-progress - probably won't work</li>
