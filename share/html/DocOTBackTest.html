<!-- <h1>Doc OTBack Test</h1> -->
<h2>OTBackTest.py</h2>

<p>Besides using the  <tt>backtest</tt> command in <a href="OTCmd2">DocOTCmd2</a>, you can run<br />
<tt>OTBackTest.py</tt> as a stand-alone script for backtesting:</p>

<pre>
usage: OTBackTest.py [-h] [-T] [-P] [-R SRECIPE] [-C SCHEF] [-H SHDFSTORE]
</pre>

<p>Give the Symbol Timeframe and Year to backtest. The Timeframe is the period in<br />
minutes: e.g. 1 60 240 1440.</p>

<h3>CSV Files</h3>

<p>In order to backtest, you will need some Open High Low Close (OHLC) data<br />
in CSV files. You can download the 1 minute history of major forex pairs from<br />
<a href="http://www.fxdd.com/us/en/forex-resources/forex-trading-tools/metatrader-1-minute-data/">http://www.fxdd.com/us/en/forex-resources/forex-trading-tools/metatrader-1-minute-data/</a><br />
The are <strong>much</strong> higher quality than using the Mt4 History Center to download.</p>

<p>The pairs include:</p>
<pre>
AUD / CAD
AUD / JPY
AUD / NZD
AUD / USD
CAD / JPY
CHF / JPY
EUR / AUD
EUR / CAD
EUR / CHF
EUR / GBP
EUR / JPY
EUR / USD
GBP / CHF
GBP / JPY
GBP / USD
NZD / USD
USD / CAD
USD / CHF
USD / JPY
USD / MXN
USD / TRY
XAG / USD
XAU / USD
</pre>
<p>The data comes as zip files, and are about 160Mbytes each, e.g.<br />
<a href="http://tools.fxdd.com/tools/M1Data/XAUUSD.zip">http://tools.fxdd.com/tools/M1Data/XAUUSD.zip</a></p>

<p>When you unzip these downloaded files they give a file in Metatrader HST format.<br />
It's probably best to make a subdirectory under the Metatrader history folder,<br />
perhaps called <tt>tools.fxdd.com</tt>.</p>

<p>To generate the CSV files, use the History Center in Metatrader.<br />
This is best done when <strong>not</strong> connected or logged in.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Select <tt>Tools&gt;History Center</tt>.</li>
	<li>Double click on the currency pair which you downloaded the data for.</li>
	<li><strong>Be sure to Highlight 1 Minute (M1)</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select Import.</li>
	<li>Browse to the file you previously downloaded to your computer  (remember it has a .hst extension) and select Ok. Now the file has  been uploaded to the History Center.</li>
	<li>Be Sure To Highlight 1 Minute (M1) and click on <tt>Export</tt></li>
	<li>Give the name of the csv file you wish to save the CSV in, perhaps in a  subdirectory under the Metatrader history folder called <tt>tools.fxdd.com</tt>.</li>
	<li>Click on OK.</li>
</ul>
<p>These CSV files have no header.</p>

<h3>Resampling to Longer Time Periods</h3>

<p>Once you have the large 1 minute history files in CSV, you will want to<br />
resample them and save them as OHLC CSV files at longer timeperiods.<br />
You can use the <tt>OTCmd2 csv resample</tt> command to do this:</p>
<pre>
python OTCmd2.py -P "c:\\Program Files\\MetaTrader" \
       csv resample SRAW1MINFILE SRESAMPLEDCSV STIMEFRAME
</pre>

<p>which will resample 1 minute CSV data that you exported (above) in the<br />
<tt>SRAW1MINFILE</tt>, to a new timeframe such as 15, 60, 240, 1440 (minutes),<br />
and save it as CSV file <tt>SRESAMPLEDCSV</tt>.</p>

<p>These resampled CSV files are what you need for the<br />
<tt>backtest feed</tt> command (see below).</p>

<p>You may want to break them up into smaller chunks, such as one file<br />
per year, so that your backtests run faster. It can be also very<br />
informative to see how much your results vary in different years.</p>
