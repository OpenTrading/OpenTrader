# the RabbitMQ server configured and running.
# echo the commands from the script so that we can watch the progress

# turn on debug tracing for now
set debug True
# set the on-line target to be the default from OTCmd2.ini

# start a listener thread running, subscribed to retval and timer topics

# sleep for 15 seconds
