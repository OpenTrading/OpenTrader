== Testing

[[UseCases]] proceed to getting fleshed out as features. 
=== Features


To run the BDD test features and scenarios, install
[[py-bdd|https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-bdd/]].
Make sure that {{{bdd}}} in your list of {{{py.test}}} plugins.


In the main directory of the distribution, run
{{{
python -v tests/
}}}

The features can be found in the 
[[tests/features/|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OpenTrader/raw/master/tests/features/]]
directory of the distribution.

For the currently documented features, see [[TestsFeatures]].

=== Examples

Features that are implemented as commands in [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] also
have tests as examples.Because [[OTCmd2|DocOTCmd2]] is a
[[cmd2|https://bitbucket.org/catherinedevlin/cmd2]] application, not only can
it interpret commands in an interactive loop, but it can read a list of
commands from the stdin. This can be used to give examples of typical [[UseCases]].

This makes it easy to write scripts as complete [[UseCase]] tests, giving good coverage.
At the same time, it gives end-users a catalogue of complete working examples.

For the currently scripted examples, see [[TestsExamples]].
