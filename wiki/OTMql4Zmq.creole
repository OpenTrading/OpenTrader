== OTMql4Zmq - ZeroMQ bindings for MQL4 Python ==

https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/

The OTMql4Zmq project allows the [[OpenTrading Metatrader-Python bridge|OTMql4Py]]
to work with [[ZeroMQ|http://zeromq.org]].
It builds on [[OTMql4Py]], and requires it as a pre-requisite.

You also must have installed [[Python|http://www.python.org]], and the 
[[OTMql4Py Python bridge|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Py/]] and
[[OTMql4Lib Metatrader library|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Lib/]].
OpenTrader runs fine with the C coded implmentation of ZeroMQ for Metatrader:
[[OTZmqCmdEA.mq4|https://github.com/OpenTrading/OTMql4Zmq/raw/master/MQL4/Experts/OTMql4/OTZmqCmdEA.mq4]]
